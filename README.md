# <Strong>_Description_</Strong>

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student.

You have work on the task for 25 minutes. And then after that, you take a short 5 minutes break. And after you've done four of these Pomodoros, basically four repetition, then you get to take a long 20 minutes break.
